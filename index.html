                <p>My name is Stephon Fraser. I was born in Georgetown, Guyana, South America; the only English speaking
                    country in the continent, and one of 3 non-spanish speaking countries. I've decided to take the
                    CS50W course to better my skills at web development, and to learn more about the development
                    community.</p>
                <p>Website Development wasn't my first choice for a career. I initially wanted to become a Doctor, but I
                    couldn't afford to go to medical school. However, later on in my life, I discovered a love for
                    creating beautiful websites. After initially learning how to do that, I didn't want to stop. This
                    was the beginning of my journey.</p>
                <p>Some of the languages I've learned are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</li>
                    <li>PHP - Hypertext Preprocessor </li>
                    <li>CSS - Cascading Stylesheets</li>
                    <li>JS - JavaScript</li>
                    <li>C Language</li>
                </ul>
