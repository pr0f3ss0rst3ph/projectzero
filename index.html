          <p>
            My name is Stephon Fraser. I was born in Georgetown, Guyana, South
            America; the only English speaking country in the continent, and one
            of 3 non-spanish speaking countries. I've decided to take the CS50W
            course to better my skills at web development, and to learn more
            about the development community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Website Development wasn't my first choice for a career. I initially
            wanted to become a Doctor, but I couldn't afford to go to medical
            school. However, later on in my life, I discovered a love for
            creating beautiful websites. After initially learning how to do
            that, I didn't want to stop. This was the beginning of my journey.
          </p>
          <p>Some of the languages I've learned are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</li>
            <li>PHP - Hypertext Preprocessor</li>
            <li>CSS - Cascading Stylesheets</li>
            <li>JS - JavaScript</li>
            <li>C Language</li>
          </ul>

              This site will show you an overview of the skills Iâ€™ve acquired
              from the CS50W course as well of the skills I already have
              knowledge of.

              I will also post information about myself that will give you a
