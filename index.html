            My name is Stephon Fraser. I am the developer of this website. This site is a part of the CS50's Project 0 assignment. In this website, I've incorporated most of the knowledge I have obtained from the CS50W course and prior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Website Development wasn't my first choice for a career. I initially
            wanted to become a Doctor, but I couldn't afford to go to medical
            school. However, later on in my life, I discovered a love for
            creating beautiful websites. After initially learning how to do
            that, I didn't want to stop. This was the beginning of my journey.
          </p>
          <p>Some of the languages I've learned are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</li>
            <li>PHP - Hypertext Preprocessor</li>
            <li>CSS - Cascading Stylesheets</li>
            <li>JS - JavaScript</li>
            <li>C Language</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="head1">About This Site</div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
              This site consists of 4 pages. I've made sure to use one standard format for all of the page to create a sense of unison between each pages, giving the entire website a light themed look.
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              Of course, the backbone of any website is HTML. With a touch of CSS (SCSS), I created a much more presentable look for our website.

              The logo was created for my blog "The Circle" which covers content and stories from the different social circles around the world.
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              One of the reason I created 'The Circle' was to be able to share interesting stories that I've heard with people who may be interested in hearing them.
