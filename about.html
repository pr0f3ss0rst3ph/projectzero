          <p>
            My name is Stephon Delano Fraser. I was born in Georgetown, Guyana, South
            America; the only English speaking country in the continent, and one
            of 3 non-spanish speaking countries. I've lived most of my life in Georgetown, Guyana, but I
            moved to a village called Diamond, Guyana in 2011. My life, like
            many others have been rough at times, but I've managed to take
            myself out of the negative and place myself into the positive.

          <div class="head2">Website Development Journey</div>
          <p>
            My interest in Web Development, or moreso web design at the time, sparked when I was 17 years old. I had just graduated high school, and was jobless and confused. The internet was in it's prime at that time, and website development was a bit new to me. I had always wanted to know how to build a website, and my curious mind went on to Google search "How to build a website". Of course, if you typed that into google, the results you'd get is, well, not one that you actually wanted. I came across these third party website builders that only give you tools they wanted to give you. Building websites were easy than you would expect, and that was a bit tiresome. I went on to use these sites anyways and created multiple website for my interests. But soon after, it got boring. Features were limited, I'd have to pay for premium tools and it was just not what I wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back then, I already had the idea that codes are behind everything 'software' and that websites were no exception. But I had no idea what they looked like. So, I decided to take a look at some actual HTML code, and boy was it confusing. I was immediately intimidated and lost confidence. However, later on, I decided to do some more research. I was determined to learn what these codes meant, and how I can use them to build my own websites. Given that I also have OCD, website design was definitely up my ally.
